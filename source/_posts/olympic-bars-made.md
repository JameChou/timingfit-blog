## How to define the excellence?
* Large loading rate
* Smooth rotation of the sleeve
* Good hand feeling
* Beautiful appearance
* ...

Then please come with me to see how those Olympic bars that meet the standards are made!

## Production process
### Purchasing
Olympic bars are usually made of steel and for different positioning requirements, the quality of steel used is also different. There are usually several kinds of steel of the following qualities:

* Q235(A3)
* No.45 Steel
* Spring Steel
* Alloy Steel

Excellent Olympic bars need alloy steel because the addition of other metal elements can make the steel have high strength and good toughness.

### Quenching

If the purchased materials cannot meet the ideal standard, then the steel must be quenched to strengthen its strength and resilience.

### Knurling
When the pattern is rolled out on the surface of the stick, the friction force can be increased, and the bar can not fall off even if it is held by force! In addition, it can help players to exert their power more easily and also reduce the injury rate.

### Surface Treatment
There are several ways to treat the surface

* Chrome
* Hard Chrome
* Black oxidation
* Zinc
* Electrophoresis

Let's compare these processes:

**Chrome** VS **Zinc**: The former can mainly improve the surface hardness, beauty and rust resistance, while the latter has good chemical stability because the color of chrome is not easy to change. Zn is an active metal and easily reacts with the acid, so its corrosion resistance is poor.

**Chrome** VS **Electrophoresis**: The surface of electrophoresis is non - metallic, which is even and more environmentally friendly with a better hand feeling, and it is more delicate. On the contrary, the plating surface is only a metal coating.

**Chrome** VS **Black oxidation**: Oxidation is the formation of an oxide film on the surface through chemical reactions. Its corrosion resistance is not as good as electroplating, but it can produce different colors.

### Bearing Structure

There are generally two types of bearings for the bearing structure of Olympic barbell bars:

**Needle bearings** and **Ball bearings**

The low-end Olympic bar basically has no bearing and is fixed by a roller, thus saving the process cost, but as a result, it is likely to hurt the wrist when weightlifting.

The most common is to use needle bearing structure. The number of needle bearings is 2,4,6,8,10. The more bearings, the better the bearing effect and rolling effect are.

### Testing

The finished products need to undergo professional testing in order to ensure that the quality of the products can really pass the strict standard.
